# covid-19-predictions-web-app-front-end

This is a team work project of me and [Ramsis Hammadi](https://github.com/Rams901) dedicated to the current situations and to make people aware of how severe it might get. We've used machine learning skills to predict the confirmed cases/deaths in infected countries with covid-19.
